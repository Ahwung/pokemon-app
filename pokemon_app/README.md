# Pokemon Database

## Technology Used:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript
- Jquery

## Approach

I wanted to create a database that would allow the user to search through the entire pokemon database and get information on each pokemon. I initially wanted to create a carousel that the user could cycle through and search through the pokedex as well to jump to the searched pokemon.

I also wanted to create a database where the user could see all pokemon in the universe separated by generation and be able to find information on each one that was clicked on as well.

## Unsolved Problems

When displaying all the pictures in the database, I ran into the issue of getting the pokemon in order by index number. I know that the jquery is loading it all really quickly, but it's not appending in order in my for loop.
